This repository provides a script for analyzing financial transaction data, specifically focusing on the inflow and outflow of funds. The analysis extracts and sums relevant values categorized under "Money In" and "Money Out" transactions, followed by a pie chart visualization to show the distribution of transaction types. Key aspects include:

Data Extraction: Identifies relevant labels for incoming (e.g., "RECEIVED MONEY") and outgoing (e.g., "SEND MONEY") transactions and computes the total amounts.
Visualization: A pie chart is created to illustrate the proportion of each transaction type within the total "Money In" and "Money Out" categories, providing a clear visual breakdown.
This analysis highlights trends in transaction types and offers insights into money inflows and outflows, useful for financial reporting or budgeting insights.
